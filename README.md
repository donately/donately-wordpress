### Testing Template

If inclined, there is a testing template that comes with a debugging page available at: http://nerdi.net/share/index.php?dir=/fiftyandfifty (download fifty-testing.zip). It is a stripped down version of the framework used specific for debugging this plugin. Brief setup:

* Install Theme and active
* Make a page called 'Debug' and use the 'Donately Debugging' template, then view the created page.
* Test/Debug manually in page-templates/debug.php
